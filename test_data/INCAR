System = Cubic CsPbI3 + I_i(0) defect in relaxed 40 atom supercell

GGA = PE        ! XC functional; PBE
IVDW = 12       ! DFT-D3 dispersion relation; additive vdW corrections to energy functional

ENCUT = 400     ! energy cutoff for plane waves; only position relax, don't need higher encut
ALGO = Normal   ! electronic minimisation algo; Blocked-Davidson scheme 
NELM = 60       ! no. electronic minimisation steps; default
EDIFF = 1E-6    ! tolerance for energy convergence
ISMEAR = 0      ! Gaussian smearing; default
SIGMA = 0.2     ! broadening of the smearing; default
LREAL = Auto	! real space evaluation of projection operators, automatically optimised
ISYM = 0        ! switches off symmetry so defect not repeated

ISIF = 2        ! relaxes ion positions, calculates stress tensor
IBRION = 3      ! quick-min algo for ionic relaxation (nec. for NEB)
POTIM = 0       ! step width scale for relaxation; 0 disables default optimisers
IOPT = 7        ! FIRE force-based optimiser for NEB; more efficient than QM?
NSW = 200       ! max no. relaxation steps
EDIFFG = -0.02  ! tolerance for forces in relaxation loop

                ! FIRE params stuff
MAXMOVE = 0.3   ! increased a bit
TIMESTEP = 0.3  ! increased a bit 

ICHAIN = 0      ! default NEB
LCLIMB = .FALSE. ! CI to push image to saddle
SPRING = -5     ! spring constant
IMAGES = 5      ! no. intermediate images

NCORE = 2       ! no. cores per orbital; integer divisor of ntasks/IMAGES
