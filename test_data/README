 Nudged elastic band calculation for alpha-CsPbI3 + I_i (0) defect in relaxed 40 atom supercell:

NEB for migration path of I_i(0) defect between "eq1" and "ap2" sites of similar energy
Initial/final structures relaxed into lower min by randomly kicked ions around, NEB images should hopefully fall near this min

Initial run to get convergence, then tighten relax params
Note: no.CPUs/IMAGES must be divisble by NCORE
Minimum energy path optimised between relaxed initial/final structures
Migration barrier taken as diference between saddle point and initial/final energies

Use fully relaxed (with cubic constraint) init/final images
5 intermediate images (7 images total), generated by interpolating between init/final structures
Can increase no. images later, just need quick convergence first
Climbing-image variant pushes highest energy image to saddle point
Don't use CI yet, relax first and then once an image close to saddle, continue with CI turned on

Pristine unit cell with relaxed geometry -> scaled up to isotropic 2x2x2 SC
I_i defect, neutral charge state -> 39 atoms in SC
6x6x6 Monkhorst-Pack kpoint grid optimised for unit cell -> scales down to 3x3x3 in reciprocal SC

Energy cutoff based off exp structure convergence tests: ENCUT=400ev
PAW, PBE+D3 XC functional, Gaussian smearing
LREAL=Auto for automatic optimisation of projection operators for PPs, evaluated in real space
ISYM=0 to turn symmetries off due to defect causing disorder in crystal
Quick-min algo with IBRION=3 easiest to use with NEB; force-based optimisation
Force tolerance weakened to 0.02eV/A for easier convergence

Run 1:
Starting with 5 images to check convergence
Full kgrid 3x3x3 to match fixed point relaxations
Try 200 steps with FIRE optimiser, increased timestep a bit
